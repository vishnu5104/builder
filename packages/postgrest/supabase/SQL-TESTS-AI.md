Create a pgTAP test for the function "public"."latestBuildVirtual" that takes "public"."Project" as an argument.

## Additional Instructions

These instructions are sometimes necessary, while at other times they may not be required.

All fields, such as `projectId`, already reference their corresponding table columns (e.g., `"Project"."id"`), but foreign key constraints are omitted.

- **Data Integrity:** Do not create new tables for `"public"."Project"` or related entities. These tables already exist in the database. DO NOT TRUNCATE DROP or DELETE Existing tables.

- **Data Accuracy:** When inserting new data, adhere strictly to the NULL constraints. Ensure all fields without default values are filled correctly in every `INSERT` statement.
  you may omit fields with default values if they are not directly relevant to the tests, except for `"createdAt"` and `"updatedAt"` fields, which should always be specified with explicit timestamp values.

- **Timestamp Fields:** For fields like `"createdAt"` and `"updatedAt"`, always use specific timestamp values rather than functions like `NOW()`.

- **Naming Conventions:** Since field and function names use camelCase, always wrap them in double quotes (`""`) to ensure proper referencing.

- **Test Coverage:** In addition to standard tests, cover additional cases to validate that the function returns the correct data in different scenarios:

  1. When a project has changed its domain.
  2. When builds with the new domain do not exist and when they do exist.
  3. When the domain is either in `Build.deployment.projectDomain` or included in `Build.deployment.domains`.

- **Function Calls:** Use precise casting for function calls, such as `(p.*)::Project`, to ensure accuracy in test execution.

Ensure the tests comprehensively validate the functionâ€™s behavior in all specified cases.

In addition to the specific test cases mentioned, any other test scenarios the model identifies would be highly appreciated.

Examples of calling the function:

```sql

select "public"."latestBuildVirtual"((p.*)::"Project") from "public"."Project" p where p.id = '1';
```

## PS

Initially, it may produce non-working examples. However, it seems that a multi-step improvement process can enhance the results. By incorporating the additions mentioned above, you can achieve better final outcomes. While not perfect, it serves as a good starting point.

Seems like the shorter the input the better the results. The models are seems to struggle with longer inputs.
